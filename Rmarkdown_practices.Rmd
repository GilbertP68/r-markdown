```{r  gapminder_filter_Australia}

# Challenge - Integrating code
# Make sure you have a copy of the gapminder data available. Then write a code chunk to:
# •Load the tidyverse package
# •Read in the gapminder data
# •Filter down to just the Australian data and print it to the screen
# •Show a plot of the Australian population over time
# Save and Knit your document when you have finished.
